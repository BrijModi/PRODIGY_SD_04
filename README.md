This project automatically solves sudoku. Its major feature is backtracing, which is used to solve sudoku. I also tried to provide a GUI for adding numbers into sudoku. When the user selects the solve button, the solved sudoku is automatically presented, along with a messagebox indicating that the sudoku has been solved.

Backtracking refers to removing the present solution to a problem if it is inadequate or unsuitable, going back (Backtracking), and trying a different approach.
